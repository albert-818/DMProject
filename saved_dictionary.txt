Like ln 1 = 0 cus e^0 =1\n\te^ln 1 = 1\nPrincess: ouayaya\n\tbless\n\ti finally can do eulers\n\tlike frfr\n\ti js need to brush up on exponentiald\nFatty Acid: YAYAYAYAYAYY\n\tso you understand like

(Might not work because might have expired already)\n\tYou set up the exponential equations for the 2 points right?\n\tmakes sense?\nPrincess: yes\nFatty Acid: Without the initial condition\n\tWhich cancels out the C\n\tAs seen here\n\tSo by dividing the two, you use the new equation to solve for k\n\tAnd then plug back in one point to get C\nPrincess: PHHHH\n\tI FOR IT\n\tGOT IT\nFatty Acid: u got it?\nPrincess: yes\nFatty Acid: you 100% understand right?\nPrincess: Temporary photo: Unable to fetch (Probably expired already)\nFatty Acid: It’s just one extra step\nPrincess: i js cant do log rules 😐\n\tand exponential\nFatty Acid: rules?\n\tOk when you think\n\tYou may have remembered a rule wrong\n\tJust do a quick test with “the rule you remember” (edited)\n\tlike for example\n\tOH NO\n\tSo let’s try it\n\tWith powers of 2 instead\n\t2^3 * 2^2\n\t= 8*4=32\n\t= 2^5\n\tSo you see how you add the exponents when you multiply two powers with the same base\nPrincess: ohhhhhhhhhghhhg\n\tokayay\n\ttheres no exponential grlwth and decah problems\n\t🫡🫡🫡\nFatty Acid: LOLLL\n\tnice nice\n\tU GOT THIS\n\tso you have calc and then Spanish\n\tRight?\nPrincess: i have

I'm afraid I will have to break our current relationship off to pursue my dreams, for the better of both of us. Furthermore, I'd still like to be friends. This is in no way your fault, and you could have done nothing to prevent this outcome. I have simply chosen to court another lady. Thank you for pointing me in the right direction of my life. I am forever in your debt, and I cannot thank you enough. I hope we can break this off amicably.\nFatty Acid: 5 + 2(diction style points) out of 10\nPrincess: LMAOAOAOOAO\n\tHELP\n\tWHAT KINDA RESPONSE\nFatty Acid: This is some like 1900’s style\nPrincess:

Acid: ok\n\tWalk me thru ur thought process\nPrincess: its D right im pretty sure its D bc basically its 135 per day, and we have x days so it should normally be y=135x but also the first day is 270 so we would have to add an extra 135 so that we\'d account for the 270 on the first day\n\ti just mean its labelled as hard but like that seems pretty easy\n\tunless im actually so wrong\nFatty Acid: yup\n\tBut I would recommend\n\tDoing it more methodically\n\tSo the key idea is\n\t:\n\t1. The first day costs 270\n\t2. Every day AFTER the first day (x-1) costs 135\n\tThe key is x-1\n\tRight? (edited)\nPrincess: yeah\n\tso (x-1)135\nFatty Acid: Yup\nPrincess: thats wrong bert\n\tcuz its 135x+135\nFatty Acid: 270 + (x-1)(135)\nPrincess: oh that\n\tLMAO\nFatty Acid: Dum dum\nPrincess: STOPPP\nFatty Acid: LMAOAOAOAOO\nPrincess: KYS\nFatty Acid: Adorable dum dum\nPrincess: okay i got it right tho\n\tyay\nFatty Acid: dumpling\n\tDumb-pling (edited)\n\tcute\n\tYes\nPrincess: R U CALLING ME FAT\n\tWHAT\n\tWHATTT\nFatty Acid: no\n\tYum\nPrincess: uh huh\n\tim grinding sat math :3\nFatty Acid: Let me know if u need any explanation, ok?\n\tdid u figure out all the problem you got wrong last time\nPrincess: no i didnt look at those yet\n\ti should tho\nFatty Acid: ok let me try to find them again\n\tin our dms\nPrincess: how do u solve this other than plugging in points\n\tPhoto: https://scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t1.15752-9/429812936_1603475450405483_2328609109762240881_n.png?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=_DActJvYrx0Q7kNvgEHsUO6&_nc_ad=z-m&_nc_cid=0&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=03_Q7cD1QFBG-GaQWxsPJBaXKQlvCKyv358T8EduCIzQx5uImfHfg&oe=66634637\nFatty Acid: That’s such a weird question\n\tLet me try some stuff\n\tOk easiest way is to just plug it in\nPrincess: and this one, like do i need to go through all the answers\n\tPhoto: https://scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t1.15752-9/428789655_1448814105993454_14333202559716918_n.png?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=SMdK7loey-4Q7kNvgFt8ceF&_nc_ad=z-m&_nc_cid=0&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=03_Q7cD1QGSDHwOeUSN1V4F5DXhSa5VLT_WEMFATLAbOBkjgAFVKA&oe=6663362F\nFatty Acid: I think\nPrincess: okkkk\nFatty Acid: But this is also\n\tTemporary photo: Unable to fetch (Probably expired already)\n\tCus the problem’s answer choices r all over the place\n\tIt’s really to just plug in the answer\n\tAnd see if the equation makes sense\nPrincess: wait for what\n\twhich one\n\tr u talking abt rn\nFatty Acid: The one I referenced in the photo\n\tso the r one\nPrincess: bro collegeboard is tweaking\n\tlike some of these questions r so hard\n\tand some of them are so easy\n\tdespite being labelled as hard\nFatty Acid: LOL\nPrincess: like how is this hard ?????\n\tPhoto: https://scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t1.15752-9/430205275_365710673090319_2551466474082955658_n.png?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=Hs6qQe3M7rUQ7kNvgFxWxKF&_nc_ad=z-m&_nc_cid=0&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=03_Q7cD1QF69mHDls4XoIeFfq--Yd4FkA9xRGmK7-wvp_TqOxdvdg&oe=666319F6\n\tthat is NOT hard\n\twhy is bros goal limiting the amt of money theyre gonna make\n\tPhoto: https://scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t1.15752-9/429746404_939173491255391_1065472681921753096_n.png?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=pWoOn9Xo_3oQ7kNvgEa9SFG&_nc_ad=z-m&_nc_cid=0&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=03_Q7cD1QHOnuuLzClP_dTcPcRDbudNzz_UBPvw8z4QJsoFD6iZPA&oe=6663345C\nFatty Acid: LOL\n\tWhat did y get for this one\n\tIg it could be a LITTLE like tricky\n\tLMAOOOOO\nPrincess: 40\n\tits 40 btw\nFatty Acid: No yeah\n\tCus I think\n\tPpl get tripped up\n\tWhen interpreting the linear equation\n\tWho knows\nPrincess: HOW IS THIS HARD\n\tPhoto: https://scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t1.15752-9/429638517_772477627771614_5633441796736611405_n.png?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=5f2048&_nc_ohc=b78KLLderqEQ7kNvgEIxWXx&_nc_ad=z-m&_nc_cid=0&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.cdninstagram.com&oh=03_Q7cD1QEsHaPddyCnSoqyuMQwvzcoS0Lpq0JDgtcv-eIJJQQwJA&oe=66634616\n\tWHAT HTE FUCK\n\ti dont think these are even\n\taccurate\n\tLMAO\nFatty Acid: LMAOAOAOAOO\n\tTHEY ARENT\n\tACCUREBT\n\tJUST DO ALL OF THEM\nPrincess: THOUGHT I WAS A GENIUS FOR A SEC\n\ti feel like i have something else to do\n\tbut im not sure\nFatty Acid: Uh oh\n\tStinky\n\tI hate that feeling\n\tCus it’s usually right\nPrincess: LIKE ITS NOT ON MY PLANNER ????

(Might not work because might have expired already)\n\tBtw\n\tThe reason why it took so long\n\tWas because\n\tI jsut spilled water all over my extension chord 🥹\nPrincess: why is it 2y on both top

outside is just y\nFatty Acid: So we make it the same as the inside\n\tSetting the inside*\n\tMeans that\n\tEvery variable-expression has to match the inside\n\tSo u can do the derivative thing\nPrincess: so why is there no 1/2 on the outside\nFatty Acid: cus we don’t need one\n\tmultiplied 2 on the top\n\tAnd the bottom\nPrincess: oh\n\tokayy\nFatty Acid: U could use the formula too\n\tBut u have to use it with u\n\twhich is why I had to do the multiply by 2\n\tOn top and bottom\n\tWhich matches all the 2y’s (edited)\n\tand gets the derivative term as well (2)\nPrincess: ohhh\n\tcan u explain 8\nFatty Acid: kk\n\tDo u understand u-sub notations now?\n\tU is the inside\n\tit’s really a lot easier\n\tWhen it gets to complex studf\nPrincess: i understand it but i forget to use it\n\texplain 8\nFatty Acid: Working. On it\n\tso I can look at it easily\n\tanswer key is wrong\n\tim almost certain\n\t^\n\tIt\'s supposed to be 1/(x* sqrt(x^2 - 4))\n\tfor this solution\n\tnot x^4\n\tsee what u get for x^4 anyways\n\tit\'s hard btw\nPrincess: yeah idk how to do that cuz wouldnt i have to pull out a 2x but i cant insert variables just constants\nFatty Acid: Temporary photo: Unable to fetch (Probably

OH\n\tI MISREAD THAT\n\tI THOUGHTBU SAID\n\tU CAME BACK TO BITE ME\nFatty Acid: …\n\t…….\nPrincess: yes\nFatty Acid: Ok\n\t^\n\tI’ll guide u\n\tOk what do u see in the diagram\n\teverything that u notice\n\tlist them out\nPrincess: promoters\n\toperon\n\tuh\nFatty Acid: ok\nPrincess: dna\nFatty Acid: More specific\n\tLook at the arrows\nPrincess: babe i don’t understand the damn arrows\n\t😓\nFatty Acid: ok before I explain it\n\tReread the question\n\tTwice\nPrincess: OH IS TRPR THE TRP REPRESSOR\nFatty Acid: .\nPrincess: srop\nFatty Acid: let’s just say\n\tI know u a little too well\n\tI literally could tell\n\tU jumped straight into the diagram 😂\n\tBrb shower\nPrincess: yeah.\nFatty Acid: See what u can figure out\nPrincess: action_log\nFatty Acid: 😂\n\tback\n\tHow’s it\nPrincess: wait ok i dont understand all of it but basically when theres like high levels of tryptophan, it triggers the trpr regulatory gene??? and produces mrna ??? which binds to the protein and activates the trp repressor, which then binds to the operator ?\n\tidek\nFatty Acid: close\n\tok so let’s set a few things straight first\n\tLet me get the image\n\tHere", '2024-03-12': '\nFatty Acid: Operon codes for enzymes that code for tryptophan\n\tSpecifically\n\tThe functional gene has the gene code\n\tFor it\n\t2.\n\tthe operator segement\n\tdecides whether or not the function gene is actually transcribed\n\tso far so good?\n\tany Q\'s\n\t?\nPrincess: what exactly is an operon\n\tand an operator\n\tLOL\nFatty Acid: OK someone didnt listen in class\n\tanywayssss\nPrincess: yeah i didnt\n\ti was texting u\nFatty Acid: ...\n\tstop\n\tSTOP TEXTING ME MID LECTURE\n\tanyways\n\toperons are bacteria genes\n\ttheir key trait\n\tis that they have a single promoter\n\tthat controls transcription\nPrincess: whats a promoter 😛😍\nFatty Acid: link\n\tthis will help a ton\n\t.\n\tgo read\nPrincess: IM READING\n\tman im hungry\n\tmy dad yelled atme when i went downstairs for food\nFatty Acid: 😢\n\t:(\nPrincess: i need more snacks in my room\nFatty Acid: 😂\nPrincess: so this whole thing is an operon right\n\tPhoto:

ok i think i got the gist of it\nFatty Acid: Promoter: Binding site for RNA polymerase\n\tif u wanted the definition\n\tbasically think of it\n\tas the area that allows gene trascription to initiate\n\tso without a promoter, what do u think is the consequence?\nPrincess: the rna polymerase cant bind\n\t?\nFatty Acid: and\nPrincess: and gene transcription wont initiate\nFatty Acid: yup\n\tthe gene wont be expressed\n\tok so now can u answer the college board\n\tquestion\nPrincess: gimme a sec\n\tlookin\n\tg\nFatty Acid: kk\nPrincess: B cuz if it\'s repressing it, its not being transcribed and the gene cant be expressed\nFatty Acid: ok unfortunately\n\tcollegeboard problems are very very\n\tannoying\n\tok reread\n\twhat the question is actually asking for\nPrincess: i think the answer is actually b tho\n\tcuz i already turned it in :3\nFatty Acid: LMAO\n\tit might actualyl be\nPrincess: i just needed help with actually reading it\nFatty Acid: maybe I ned to be\n\treread\nPrincess: oh wait hold on\n\tmaybe not\n\tquizlet said b!\n\tbut i dont get how the other answers relate to tryptophan\nFatty Acid: I honestly dont see how b is the answer\n\tit\'s D\n\t:)\nPrincess: BUT HOW IS IT D\nFatty Acid: wait\nPrincess: it is D\n\tbut how\nFatty Acid: Photo:

ill explain collegboard logic\n\tI HATE\n\tcollegeboard mcq\n\t\'s\n\twith a burning passion\n\tbut\nPrincess: NO CUZ LIKE TRYPTOPHAN ISNT REPRESSING IT IF ITS BEING TRANSCRIBED REGARDLESS\n\tso how does it coreprwss\n\t😓😓\nFatty Acid: RN\n\tthe problems says\n\twhen tryptophan levels are high\n\ttrp gene isnt transcribed\n\tcorrrect?\nPrincess: yeah\nFatty Acid: so a corepressor\n\tand activates it\n\tWhat is a corepressor vs repressor?\nRepressor: It is a protein that attaches directly to DNA or RNA and prevents one or more genes from being expressed. Corepressors: These are special transcriptional protein regulators that help to regulate repressors without binding to DNA.\n\tbtw fyi\nPrincess: action_log\nFatty Acid: ok\n\tkey idea\n\ttryptophan does not directly bind to the DNA\n\tSO\n\tin this scenario\n\tif trpR\n\tis mutated\n\tit doesnt work anymore, correct?\nPrincess: yeah\nFatty Acid: so we dont have anymore repressors\n\tany more*\n\tlike the little fork proteins\nPrincess: uh huh\nFatty Acid: IF trytophan is NOT a corepressor\n\tand directly attaches to DNA/RNA\n\tregardless whether the trpR is mutated or not\n\tto the operator\n\tand regulates it\n\tis that making any sense?\nPrincess: sorta\nFatty Acid: my explanation is a little covoluted\n\tlet me simplify it\n\tthis is more direct reasoning\n\tsince we know\n\ttrpR is needed to regulate\n\ttrp\n\ttrptophan has to be a "corepressor" that regulates the DNA thru trpR\n\tbecause what option D tells us\n\tis\n\twhen trpR is produced\n\tisnt*\n\tour trp gene isnt regulated\n\tby the amount of trp\nPrincess: is it cuz since the amount of trp isnt being regulated when trpr is mutated, tryptophan has to be a corepressor or it would still be regulating trp\n\tor smthn\n\ti’m slow i can’t\nFatty Acid: so essentially\n\tWe’re seeing whether it’s a repressor or coreprrssor\nPrincess: ohhh\n\tok i kinda get it now\n\ti think\nFatty Acid: yeah yeah\nPrincess: my throat feels so weird rn\n\tergh\nFatty Acid: Is it possibly hormones?\n\tor just sickness\nPrincess: no clue\n\t:3\n\tmy voice is dying\nFatty Acid: that’s unfortunate\n\tdid u talk a lot\n\tToday?\nPrincess: no it was dying since i woke up\nFatty Acid: Oh\n\tDehydrated maybe?\n\tOR MATBE\n\tRN\nPrincess: :3\n\tyour girl :3\nFatty Acid: Sleep\n\tRn\n\tYeah\n\tYou’re

just go into the lnx\nFatty Acid: yes\n\tHave u learned\n\tU sub\n\tnotation 😂\nPrincess: wouldnt it jsut be lnudu tho\nFatty Acid: U would treat ln x\n\tLike just “u”\n\tOr like a single variable\nPrincess: oh the whole thing ???\nFatty Acid: Oh wait\n\tI didn’t read\nPrincess: all of lnx would be u ????\nFatty Acid: no ok\n\tCus\n\tdu is the derivative\n\tOf whatever\n\tU decide is I\n\tU*\n\tYou decide is u\n\tSo if u is ln x (edited)\n\tWhat’s du?\nPrincess: 1/x\n\tbut what if u decide u is just x\n\tdu would just be 1\n\tand ln(u)du would just be lnx\nFatty Acid: Of ln u du\nPrincess: oh and that would be the exact same thing\n\tso it wouldnt work\nFatty Acid: yes\n\tYes\n\tLMAO\n\tdon’t forget you’re taking an integral ….\n\t💀💀\nPrincess: riht\nFatty Acid: I want y to\nPrincess: but omay whats the integral of lnx/x then\n\tlike 1/x goes back in\nFatty Acid: Let me go to acad first\nPrincess: so youre left with lnx\nFatty Acid: So can u practice u

and he just walked past her but then he later texted asking where she was and she was like i literally called out to u. and he said he didnt hear and thought she was still inside one of the stores. and then kaylah basically snapped at him and was like being super dry and stuff and then when they got off the bus mason like ignored her and wouldnt look at her and kaylah was hurt abt that. and then 2 hours later he was like we need to talk later tn and idk what happened from ther\n\te\nFatty Acid: Oh my\n\tIs this sat reading\n\tSection\n\tJesus Christ\n\tThat’s a fight\n\tAnd.

is\n\tRight?\n\tmaking sure\nPrincess: yes\nFatty Acid: Ok\n\tSo\n\tBasically we need to keep track of how much snow is removed\n\tThis function will have 3 segments\n\tJust like g\n\tHow much snow is removed from 0-6?\nPrincess: 0\nFatty Acid: Ok nice\n\tSo that’s the value for h for that interval\n\tWhat abt the 6-7\n\tAny clue?\nPrincess: 6-7 is 125 ??? idek\nFatty Acid: 125 is the rate\n\tcorrect?\nPrincess: yeah\nFatty Acid: We do rate * time\n\tSpecifically\n\tThe amt of time passed between 6-7\nPrincess: so its just 125 * t\n\tor well 125 cuz only one hour passes\nFatty Acid: ^\n\tIncorporate this in ur function\n\tIf t= 6.5\nPrincess: t-6\nFatty Acid: Ding ding\n\tCorrect\nPrincess: 125(t-6)\nFatty Acid: Yup\n\tOk now\n\tHow much snow is removed\n\tAt 7\nPrincess: 125\nFatty Acid: So any snow that we remove after 7\n\tNeeds to be added on to 125\n\tMakes sense?\nPrincess: after 7 it would be\n\t125+108(t-7)\nFatty Acid: Ding ding\nPrincess: yayayya\n\tokay that makes more sense\n\tthe answer key wasnt making sense to me\nFatty Acid: Yayyy\n\tGlad I could help\n\tMy pricness\nPrincess: please help\n\tPhoto:

many ppl are getting on the ride per hr\n\tWhen would the line be getting longer!\n\t?*\nPrincess: 800 people are getting on the ride each hour and the line would be getting longer if more people are getting in the line than on the ride\nFatty Acid: So when would the line be longest\n\tor more so\n\tWhen would the line be increasing\nPrincess: well the line increases from hour 2 to hour 3 but in hour 4 less than 800 people join the ride so hour 3 ?\n\twait the graph is how many people join the line right\n\tand not how many people are in line\nFatty Acid: Yup\n\tYou’re right\n\tCorrect\nPrincess: wait does it go position velocity acceleration\nFatty Acid: Yeah\n\t-> derivative\nPrincess: speed is |velocity| ?\nFatty Acid: Yup\nPrincess: wait\n\tokay\nFatty Acid: U have to take the integral separately though\n\tfor sections with positive and negative velocity\n\tWhen finding distance*\nPrincess: can u show me an example\nFatty Acid: Kk\n\thmm can’t find anything

Yes\n\tcorrect\n\tdisplacement from whatever time to whatever time\nPrincess: to find total distance we have to integrate the speed function which is essentially | velocity |\n\tabsolute value of

how does it work\n\thelp\nFatty Acid: WDYM\nPrincess: WHAT TYPI\n\tHOW DO U FIND INTERSECTION\n\tSTUFF\nFatty Acid: Ohhh\nPrincess: explain how u get the andwer\nFatty Acid: I thought she was asking

what abt 6 theta\n\tcuz thats what we wanna find\nFatty Acid: She made a typo\n\tOr whoever the teacher is\nPrincess: is it supposed to be 5 sin ???\nFatty Acid: The answer key solved it with 5 sin\nPrincess: no they just changed it\nFatty Acid: Huh?\nPrincess: the answer key is the answer for a sim problem\nFatty Acid: Who changed it\nPrincess: but not the one\nFatty Acid: OH\nPrincess: the teacher\nFatty Acid: let me redo it\nPrincess: nvm\n\tshe says to just use\n\t5 sin\nFatty Acid: It’s like the same problem\nPrincess: cuz it doenst matter\nFatty Acid: yeah\n\tBasically\n\tSo^\n\tThis still stands\n\tDoes it make sense?\n\tthe rest of the work is just doing adding up the 3 integrals\n\t1 for each “piece”\nPrincess: how do u know which intersection point\nFatty Acid: which intersection point....\n\tfor the bound?\nPrincess: ^\n\ttheres two\n\tyes\nFatty Acid: you also graph the polar graph\nPrincess: theres 1.5708 and 2.61\n\twhat\nFatty Acid: which looks like this one\n\tthe 1.5708 is the "earlier" intersection\n\tthe 2.61 is the second\n\t*earlier as in like lower in theta value\n\tbc thing\n\tyou\'re inputting it like it\'s a normal function on x y plane\n\tcoordinates\n\tyou can also graph the actual POLAR functions\n\twhich gives the circle and the other shape\nPrincess: wait but how do you figure out which intersection point to use - grace\n\talso tysm for helping - grace\n\tbut yeah i graphed it like a normal function and as a polar function\nFatty Acid: ok let me write a more detailed explanation\n\tstep 1: We already found the value of the 2 intersections: 1.5708 and 2.652\n\tstep 2: we match those intersection points to the points on the polar graph\n\tthe 1.5708 is also pi/2, so it\'s the intersection point at 12 o clock\n\tand 2.652 is the other intersection point\n\tstep 3: analyze the polar graph in a clock wise direction to determine the bounds\n\tand function to integrate\n\twhen we are integrating on a polar plane, effectively we are taking slices at every angle\nPrincess: LMAO WE GET IT NOW\n\tokay thanks bert\nFatty Acid: from 0 - pi/2, if you sort of "draw lasers"\n\tok ok\n\tokkkkkkkkkk\n\tnp\n\tLMAOOOOOO\nPrincess: i lowkey forgot that one of the intersection points would be the pi/2 point - grace\n\tMy badddd -g\nFatty Acid: LMAOOOOOOOO\nPrincess: THANK UUU - g\nFatty Acid: np :)\n\tI miss calc\n\tso fujn\nPrincess: kys\nFatty Acid: LMAOOOOOOO\nPrincess: only u and adrian would think that\nFatty Acid: ehhhh\n\tmore like just me\n\tcalc is like putting

formula for polar area is the 1/2 integral (r^2) thing\nFatty Acid: this is a different formula\n\tthe idea is that you set it up like normal integrals\n\ty dx\n\tbut dx can be written as:\n\tdx/dtheta * dtheta\n\tso derivative of x with respect to theta * d theta\n\tIt’s more cus we’re provided functions of y and x in theta\n\tInstead of r in theta\n\tPhoto:

is answer key\nFatty Acid: 7yeah\n\tso what I said\n\tLOL\nPrincess: and we use the function representing the wait time and integrate that to see how long they had to wait over the two hour period\n\tand then divide by the total amt of people\n\t???\nFatty Acid: yup\n\tintegrate rate at which ppl enter -> total amount of ppl entered\n\tintegrate wait time at a particular time\n\t-> sum of ALL wait time or the total wait time\n\tthen you use those to get average wait time per perosn\nPrincess: okie\n\tlove you\n\tfew more questions\nFatty Acid: love you

ohhh okay\n\tcan u explain d :3\nFatty Acid: ofc\nPrincess: avg value of a function or avg rate of change is found by integrating the function / rate and dividing by the upper bound - lower bound right\nFatty Acid: Im still working on it btw\n\tyes\n\tok for d\n\tSince W(8) < R(8) and W(0) > R(0), the graphs of R(t) and W(t) must have at least 1 intersection\n\ttherefore\n\tW(8)\n\tW(8(*\n\tR(8\nPrincess: what is with the emojis\n\tLMAO\nFatty Acid: it got auto convereted\n\tLMAOOOO\nPrincess: IM CRYING\n\tITS SO GOOFY\nFatty Acid:

i dont get it\n\t:<\nFatty Acid: ah\n\tthat\'s an interesting\n\tapplication of intermediate value thereom\n\tthat\'s the legit way of doing it\n\tfirst of all\n\tdo you remember intermediate value thereom\nPrincess: sort of\nFatty Acid: Photo:

a function is continuous\n\tfor any value between some two values f(a) and f(b)\nPrincess: okay got it\n\tnow explain\nFatty Acid: so\n\twe see\n\tW(0) - R(0) > 0\n\tW(8 - R(8 < 0\n\ttherfore\n\tat some point between 0 and 8\n\tthere must be a point where W(t) - R(t) = 0\nPrincess: OH WAIT\n\tI KINDA GET IT\nFatty Acid: YAYYYY\nPrincess: so basically since the function w(t)-r(t) is continuous on the interval [0,8] and the values on that interval contain 0 since w(0)-r(0) is greater than 0 and w(eight)-r(eight) is less than 0, there is a value where it is 0 since basically all values between w(0)-r(0) and w(eight)-r(eight) are on that line\nFatty Acid: yes\nPrincess: yayayay\n\tokay few more questions :3\nFatty Acid: hehehehe\nPrincess: or i could ask tmr\nFatty Acid: ummmm\n\tup to

Acid: Let’s start with c\n\tWhat do you think the question is abt\n\ttell me any ideas u have\nPrincess: its asking what time after 300 seconds where theres no more people in the line\n\toh\n\twait\n\tnvm\n\ti got it\n\toops\n\ttheres no more people entering after 300 seconds\nFatty Acid: Yup\nPrincess: and in question b we find out theres 80 people left in line\n\tso we divide 80 by the rate out\n\tand add that to 300\n\toops\nFatty Acid: LOL\n\tyup\n\tThat’s it\nPrincess: what abt d\nFatty Acid: They’re all the same\n\tEssentially\n\tWhat information do we have\n\tFor D\n\tcan you list them out\nPrincess: well we know theres 20 people at the start and we want to find when theres like a minimum amt of people\n\twe have the rate people r entering\n\tand exiting\nFatty Acid: yes\n\tso what can we do with the rate\nPrincess: what they did was they derived the equation\n\tbut like i kinda get\n\tbc we wanna find min\n\tand min is the 0 of the derivative\n\tbut why did they derive the integral and not just the rate\nFatty Acid: Here’s the idea\n\tThe min of the number of ppl in line\n\tIsn’t at when the rate is 0\n\tWhen rate is 0, it means the number of ppl in line isn’t **changing**\n\twhen we take the integral od rate\n\thow many ppl are in line at a particular time\n\tSo THIS is the function that we need to find the min for\nPrincess: OH\n\twait\n\tokay\n\ti got it\n\tthank you :3\nFatty Acid: You’re welcome :3\nPrincess: yayayyay :3\n\tPhoto:

NADPH\n\tmeaning it actually oxidizes NADPH\n\tturning it into NADP+\n\tso not C\n\tnot A, cus not part of calkin\n\tcalvin\n\thence B\n\tthat\'s the purpose right? of calvin\n\tto make sugars using ATP\nPrincess: i didnt know what a three carbon carbohydrate was\nFatty Acid: it\'s a sugar\n\ta normal carbohydrate\n\twell I think speicfically\n\tit\'s G3P\nPrincess: ohhh i thought it tuened nadp

here\'s how I think of it\n\tlight dependent reaction is like a charger\n\tyour nadph and atp\'s are battery packs\n\tthey contain the energy\n\tthe light dependent makes the ATP and NADPH from adp + p and nadp\n\twith the energy from the sun\n\tthe light independent reactions uses those ATP and NADPH -> ADP + P and NADP\n\tusing the energy from ATP and the electrons from NADPH to *BUILD* the sugar from co2\nPrincess: and this is oxidation right\n\tis oxidation\nFatty Acid: Yes\n\tSorry my dad was in my room\nPrincess: can u explain this\n\tits okie\nFatty Acid: That is a WEIRD
